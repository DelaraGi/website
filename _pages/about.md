## Membership and Participation

It is not a requirement to be employed at a Member company to participate as a developer or in the OpenAMP Technical Steering Committee.  Community participation is welcome!

Governance of the community project is overseen by a board of representatives from Member companies.  Member fees support administration for the project, such as the project website and mailing lists.
