SoCs (System on a Chip) are becoming more heterogeneous, with multiple processor clusters and special-purpose accelerators. As a result, AMP (Asymmetric MultiProcessing) systems need to be able to run different operating environments side-by-side on the same chip. Developing a standard shared memory scheme for the configuration and interaction between these environments will simplify working with SoCs.

OpenAMP (Open Asymmetric Multi-Processing) is a framework providing the software components needed to enable the development of software applications for AMP systems. It allows operating systems to interact within a broad range of complex homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures and allows asymmetric multiprocessing applications to leverage parallelism offered by the multicore configuration.
